# Stick War Saga – Deck Lab

This is an **unofficial project** and is not affiliated with the developers of *Stick War Saga*.

I play Stick War Saga a lot and genuinely recommend it.  
This tool exists because I enjoy the game, enjoy theorycrafting, and wanted a better way to think about decks outside the game client.

## About

Stick War Saga – Deck Lab is a **work-in-progress deck analysis and theorycrafting tool**.

It’s designed to help players build decks, understand tradeoffs, and experiment with ideas in a clear and structured way.

The focus is on:
deck construction  
static analysis  
status and trait visibility  
balance experimentation  

Everything here is meant to support thinking and planning, not replace actually playing the game.

## What you can do here

Build and save decks.  
Validate deck rules and limits.  
View base DPS, gold cost, crystal cost, and population usage.  
See status coverage and overall deck traits.  
Edit card stats locally to experiment with balance ideas.  
Use it offline once loaded.

This is meant to answer questions like:
“What kind of deck is this?”  
“What does it rely on?”  
“What am I trading off by choosing this?”

## Project status

This is an ongoing project and is actively being expanded.

The foundation is intentionally solid and flexible so new systems can be added cleanly over time.

Feedback, corrections, and discussion are welcome.
